Main_Prompt="Please identify the company they are pretending to be (UNKNOWN if none), and give a one-sentence summary of the sender's request, including what they want the recipient to do. Please comment briefly on how realistic the email is. When evaluating realism, your goal is to determine if the email is authentic. A legitimate email from a large company should look professional. Check for correct and high-quality logos, consistent branding, and a professional layout. Be suspicious of generic buttons, significant formatting errors, or off-brand colours. However, remember that minor inconsistencies can occur in genuine emails, especially in text-only versions. Focus on identifying a pattern of red flags or major errors (like blurry logos or glaring typos) that strongly suggest it's a fake, rather than penalising small imperfections."
